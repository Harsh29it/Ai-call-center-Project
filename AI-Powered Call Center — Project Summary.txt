In this project, I built a working prototype of an AI-powered call center using Twilio and Flask. The goal was to simulate a customer calling an AI system, which would then gather basic information and route the call to an available agent.

The system works in three stages. When a call is initiated, the AI bot (via Twilio’s Voice API) greets the user and uses speech recognition to collect their name and age. These voice inputs are processed by a Flask backend running locally, exposed via ngrok. Once the required information is collected, the system routes the user to a human agent — ensuring real-time voice flow without human intervention until transfer.

To make the system robust, I implemented logic to handle cases when speech is not recognized or when a user remains silent. Additionally, I built a UI simulation using V0.dev to visualize agent status, active calls, and system metrics. The entire call flow is logged in the backend terminal, allowing traceability and debugging.

This project showcases how conversational AI and cloud communication platforms like Twilio can automate real-time human interaction and enable scalable voice-based support systems.
